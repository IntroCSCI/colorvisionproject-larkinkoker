## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

string, bitmap, pixel, char and vector data types and variables are used to collect and store the data of the bitmaps and user input.
### Console Input and Output

User inputs a bitmap file that they want to use and the program outputs wheter the bitmap is safe for or not to colorblind people

### Decisions

The program will make decisions on if a images colo combination is safe or not.

### Iteration

If the pixel colors do not reflect the pixels required for certain coloblind combinations, i.e. red green coloblind and so on, then the image is safe, if it does it is not. then the program will repeat unless told not to continue

### File Input and Output

User inputs a bitmap file that they want to use and the program outputs wheter the bitmap is safe for or not to colorblind people
